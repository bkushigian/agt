AGT
===

`agt` is a basic algebraic graph theory library. It provides a simple API to
play around with/implement different graph-theoretic algorithms.

## Using AGT

`agt` is simply to use - just import it. No outside packages have been used, so
as long as you are running Python 3.5 or above you should be fine.
